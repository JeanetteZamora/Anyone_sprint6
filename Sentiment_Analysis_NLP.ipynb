    "# Sentiment Analysis: Large Movie Review Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi again! You will be expected to finish this on your own, but you can use the available channels on Discord to ask questions and help others. Please read the entire notebook before starting, this will give you a better idea of what you need to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is related to NLP. As you may already know, the most important and hardest part of an NLP project is pre-processing, which is why we are going to focus on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the data, we are not going to have a __csv file__, that would be too easy :) instead we are going to download the data from [AI Stanford Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). When you download them you will notice that their format is text files, so you will have to work a little there to be able to use and process them. This is a dataset for __binary sentiment classification__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically a basic sentiment analysis problem, as in this case, consists of a classification problem, where the possible output labels are: `positive` and `negative`. Which indicates, if the review of a movie speaks positively or negatively. In our case it is a binary problem, but one could have many more \"feelings\" tagged and thus allow a more granular analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### These are the objectives of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read data that is not in a traditional format.\n",
    "* Put together a set of preprocessing functions that we can use later on any NLP or related problems.\n",
    "* Vectorize the data in order to apply a machine learning model to it: using BoW or TF-IDF.\n",
    "* BoW and TF-IDF are classic ways to vectorize text, but currently we have some more complex ways with better performance, for this we are going to train our own word embedding and use it as a vectorization source for our data.\n",
    "* Train a sentiment analysis model that allows us to detect positive and negative opinions in movie reviews."

However, we must train a model, so choose a model of your choice (obviously a classification model, given the problem we are facing) and apply everything we learned. Also if you want you can try several models, the more models you use and know better!\n",
